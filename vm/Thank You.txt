Much of the code in this early draft of the VM is based on, or simply cribbed from,
the CLOX interpreter illustrated in Robert Nystrom's excellent book "Crafting Interpreters."

It turns out he put the code for the CLOX interpreter under the MIT license.
The entire programming-language community owes him a great debt of gratitude
for that grand and selfless gesture. And Sophie's nascent VM owes its very
existence to that same generosity.

All the rest of Sophie has always been under the MIT license as well,
so for the license to the code in this folder,
consult the LICENSE file at the repository root just as you might expect.
