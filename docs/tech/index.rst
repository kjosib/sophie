Mechanics of Sophie
====================

This chapter contains notes on the design and implementation of nontrivial subsystems.
I'll add notes as they seem necessary while the overall system fills out.

.. note::
    If you just want to use Sophie, you can skip this section.
    If you want to make Sophie better, or apply Sophie ideas in your own language, read on.
