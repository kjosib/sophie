How to Contribute
==================

There are many ways.

* Play with the notation in a design context. Add whatever extra notation you seem to need. Then report back on what you learned.
* Find ways to get some task or another done with Sophie as-is. (I'm thinking physics homework.) Explain what you did and your workflow.
* Useful functions are useful. Maybe you're the motivation for adding something meaningful to the standard library.
* Maybe you even contribute directly to the implementation.

In any event, if you contribute, you need to make sure the contribution is unencumbered by intellectual-property concerns.
