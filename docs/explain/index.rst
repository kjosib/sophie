====================

You've found the index of explanatory pages.
As the documentation continues to settle into shape,
the proper goal of these pages should be to
help you understand what **Sophie** is *specified* to do with your code.

* Not everything works yet.
* How **Sophie** works on the inside is a :doc:`completely different matter <../tech/index>`.
