Learn Sophie (if you already know how to program)
=================================================

Welcome, and thank you for taking time out to learn Sophie.
I hope she gives you a new perspective on CS.
You'll find she's a little different from what the average coding boot-camps are teaching these days,
but `vive la diff√©rence!`

.. note::
	I'm currently focusing on the "absolute beginner" chapter(s).
