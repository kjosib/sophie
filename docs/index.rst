Welcome to Sophie's documentation!
==================================

Sophie is a call-by-need strong-inferred-type language named for French mathematician Sophie Germain.

The design goals are:

1. Have Fun!
2. Keep it simple.
3. Subjectively readable appearance in my personal opinion.
4. Be pragmatic. Trade cheap computer power for having a nicer time.
