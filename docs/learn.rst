Learn Sophie (by Example)
=========================================

Welcome, and thank you for taking the time to learn Sophie.
She's a little different from what the average coding boot-camps are teaching these days,
but *vive la diff√©rence!* I hope she gives you a new perspective on CS.

Initial Preparations
---------------------

Sophie is first and foremost a language for expressing ideas about computations that might happen.
That means you can write *and reason about* Sophie programs without any computer.
Sophie is meant to be suitable for the blackboard or publication in a magazine.
There are no special formatting requirements.

But if you'd like to put your computer up to the task of evaluating (executing, running) Sophie programs,
you'll need an interpreter. You can get one easily enough:
Follow the directions at :doc:`quick_start` and then come back here.

Your First Program in Sophie
------------------------------

Virtually every programming tutorial starts the same way::

    begin:
        "Hello, World!";
        "All done here.";
    end.

If you followed directions earlier, you already have a copy of this program at ``examples/hello_world.sg``.

Now suppose you're at a command-prompt_ and you've set the current-directory_ to wherever you extracted Sophie.
If you then run::

    py -m sophie examples/hello_world.sg

you will see::

    Hello, World!
    All done here.

Let's break this down:

* Sophie programs are files.
* The main program begins with the phrase ``begin:``.
* Next comes a sequence of steps. Sophie follows those steps, one after another:
    * Each step is an *expression* of some value.
    * Sophie computes the value of that expression, and then displays the result.
    * Here we've only seen one kind of expression (the humble ``string``) but there are other kinds to handle all of computing.
    * If that expression should happen to be a ``drawing``, then the display is graphical. Sophie supports something called "Turtle Graphics". Deets later.
* Finally, every Sophie program ends with the phrase ``end.`` with a period.
    * Why? Because it looks nice in print.
* At the moment, Sophie is implemented as a Python program.
    * So in general, you will invoke ``py -m sophie`` followed by the pathname_ to your program.
    * Some day, this may change. If you'd like to help that along, let's talk about something called *self-hosting*.


Super-Fancy Calculator
--------------------------

Here's a small program showing how math (and comments) in Sophie appears::

    begin:
        3 + 4 * 5;            # Precedence works like you learned in school.
        ( 3 + 4 ) * 5;        # You can always override that with parentheses
        sqrt(1+1);            # A number of mathematical functions and constants are built-in.
    end.

You can't miss the explanatory text on each line.
Sophie sees the ``#`` mark and concludes that the remainder of that line is a comment.
(This is a fairly typical convention.)
Comments are great for telling *people* about your code, for Sophie ignores them.

Let's break down the meaning of each expression, line-by-line:

* ``3 + 4 * 5``: Produces ``23`` because multiplication comes before addition.
* ``( 3 + 4 ) * 5``: Produces ``35`` because parenthesis.
* ``sqrt(1+1)``: Produces ``1.4142135623730951``.
  The name ``sqrt`` refers to a pre-defined function which computes the square-root of what you give it.
  This expression means to apply the number ``2`` to the function called ``sqrt`` and use the result.
  Some functions take more than one input value: just put a comma (``,``) between each parameter.

You can see more examples in the ``some_arithmetic.sg`` example file.

Define your own!
------------------

Functions are the backbone of programming.
Indeed, all of computing amounts to evaluating functions of varying complexity.
So it's time to talk about how to make and use them.

The usual standard explanation would begin something like this::

    define:
        double(x) = x + x;
        square(x) = x * x;
        area_of_rectangle(length, width) = length * width;
        five = 5;
    begin:
        double(five);          # 10
        square(five);           # 25
        double(square(five));    # 50
        square(double(five));     # 100
        area_of_rectangle(20, 30)  # 600
    end.
    
We have here a simple Sophie program that defines three functions, called ``double``, ``square``, and ``area_of_rectangle``.
It also defines a constant, called ``five``, which conveniently enough refers to the number ``5``.

Let's break this down:

* In Sophie, the definitions of functions (and constants) go in a section introduced with ``define:``.
* In this program, the names ``x``, ``length``, and ``width`` serve as *formal parameters*.
  That means the ``x`` in  ``double(x)`` is a place-holder for whatever other actual value.
  Same for ``length`` and ``width`` in ``area_of_rectangle``.
* When you want to write a function of more than one parameter, separate them by a comma.
* You can, of course, refer to functions from within functions.

.. admonition:: Names are Important

    Consider the implications if ``five`` were instead called ``six`` in a large program:
    People might look at the word *six* and mistakenly guess that it would mean ``6``,
    as it *would* in a sane world.

    This sort of treachery is typically called *unmaintainable* by those in the business,
    but I have a better word for it: *unethical*. Don't do it.
    Pick names that evoke the proper meaning.
    If the meaning is abstract, pick an abstract name.
    The most abstract names of all are single letters near the end of the alphabet.

More Fun with Functions
-------------------------

You can do quite a bit with functions.
Consider this example::

    define:
        iterate_four_times(fn, x) = fn( fn( fn( fn( x ) ) ) );

        root(square) = iterate_four_times(newton, 1) where
            newton(guess) = (guess + square/guess) / 2;
        end root;

    begin:
        root(2);   # 1.4142135623746899 -- good to 13 digits!
    # Exact value is 1.4142135623730951

        root(17);  # 4.126106627581331 -- Only the first three digits are correct,
    # Exact value is 4.123105625617661 -- but it's all downhill from there.
    end.


This program illustrates Isaac Newton's method for figuring square-roots.
The method achieves excellent accuracy after just a few steps if you start with a decent guess.
(Start with a bad guess, and it takes a few extra steps. Selecting good guesses is a topic for another time.)

Once again, let's study the bits.

* ``iterate_four_times`` is a function which *takes a function* as one of its parameters.
  The *body expression* is to call that function on the result of... well, you get the point.
  (One convention to make this scenario clear is visible in how the parameters are named:
  ``fn`` is commonly the name of a function. Similarly, ``x`` is often a number.)

* The first key point about ``root`` is the ``where`` clause.
  It allows you nest functions within functions (within functions... etc.).
  In this case, ``newton`` is defined within ``root``.
  That's useful for two things:

  * First, it hides the internals. If ``newton`` is only relevant to ``root``,
    then only ``root`` needs to see ``newton``. This is a good way to limit the amount
    of information you need to keep in your head at once.

  * Second, it allows ``newton`` to see values that only exist within the context of ``root``.
    Specifically, ``newton`` can use the value of ``square`` even when ``iterate_four_times`` calls it.
    This phenomenon is called *closure*.

More Apples and More Oranges

* *Take a look at type-report and ``iterate_four_times`` specifically.*
* *Discuss the types of higher-order functions generally.*

Making Decisions
--------------------

So far, we've seen arithmetic and how to use functions, but no way to decide between options.
Let's fix that.
Sophie has three of what we call *conditional forms,* or ways to represent decision-points in a program.
I'll cover the first two of these here, and the last in the section about data structures.

Case Study: Age Classifier
...........................
Here's an example of a not-always-totally-respectful age-classifier::

    define:

    age(years) = case
        when years < 0.3 then "infant";
        when years < 1.5 then "baby";
        when years < 3 then "toddler";
        when years < 8 then "child";
        when years < 13 then "big kid";
        when years < 20 then "teenager";
        when years < 25 then "young adult";
        when years < 65 then "grown adult";
        when years < 80 then "senior citizen";
        else "geriatric";
    esac;

    begin:
    	age(1);
    	age(10);
    	age(100);
    end.

The ``case`` - ``when`` - ``then`` - ``else`` - ``esac`` structure
represents a multi-way decision.
You might not agree with the precise thresholds or translations,
but what's going on should be pretty clear.
Sophie looks for the first ``when`` clause that is true in context,
and evaluates the corresponding ``then`` clause.
If no ``when`` clause is true, then Sophie evaluates the ``else`` clause instead.

	And what about that funny word ``esac``? Well, it's ``case`` spelled backwards.
	It makes for a nice symmetric open-and-close, sort of like parentheses.
	We could probably live without it for this particular structure
	because ``else`` is always last here,
	but Sophie uses the word ``case`` in a couple other ways where clear
	containment is less obvious without the closing bracket.
	So this is a nod to consistency,
	which will make for easier composition and reading.

* Exercise:
	Observe that this demo calls the ``age`` function with a few different
	sample arguments ``1``, ``10``, and ``100``. Think about what result you expect
	in each of these scenarios, and why that is the result you expect.

* Exercise:
	Actually run the example code.
	See how things line up with your expectations.

* Exercise:
	Try mixing up the order in which the ``when`` ... ``then`` clauses appear.
	What happens?
	Can you adjust the ``when`` conditions to make them work properly regardless of the order in which they appear?

* Exercise:
	Can you think of a way for Sophie to check for overlap between the conditions?
	If so, how does your idea change when the conditions get more complicated?

Case Study: Improved Root-Finder
...................................

Let's improve our root-finding program.
You may have noticed that it did significantly better with ``root(2)`` than with ``root(17)``.
To get a better answer for larger numbers, one approach we could take is to iterate Newton's method more times.
We could do this::

    define:
        iterate_six_times(fn, x) = fn( fn( fn( fn( fn( fn( x ) ) ) ) ) );

        root(square) = iterate_six_times(newton, 1) where
            newton(guess) = (guess + square/guess) / 2;
        end root;

    begin:
        root(2);   # 1.414213562373095   -- As good as we're going to get.
        sqrt(2);   # 1.4142135623730951  -- That last digit is a topic for another day.

        root(17);  # 4.123105625617805   -- Quite a bit better now,
        sqrt(17);  # 4.123105625617661   -- but still not quite perfect.

        root(170_000);  # 2677.54397787486   -- Ack! Horribly wrong.
        sqrt(170_000);  # 412.31056256176606  -- It should be 100x that for 17.
    end.

..

    For the record, ``sqrt`` is the built-in math function for taking square-roots,
    so that's convenient for testing against.

In this example, I've added two more rounds of Newton's Method (and renamed a certain function accordingly).
Even still, it's not enough.
Feed a big enough number into the ``root(...)`` function and it stops too soon.

	Of note, you can have underscores in numbers
	like ``123_465.789_012`` and you can group them as you like,
	so long as there is a digit on both sides of every underscore.

It would be nice if we could let Sophie figure out when to stop.
Perhaps we come up with a function like this::

    define:
        root(square) = iterated(newton(1), 1) where               # Note 6
            newton(root) = (root + square/root) / 2;
            iterated(x, y) =                                      # Note 2
              x if good_enough else iterated(newton(x), x) where  # Note 1
                good_enough = relative_difference < 1e-14;        # Note 3, 4
                relative_difference = fabs(x-y) / (x+y) ;         # Note 5
             end iterated;
        end root;

    begin:
        root(2);        # 1.414213562373095    # Note 7
        sqrt(2);        # 1.4142135623730951

        root(17);       # 4.123105625617661
        sqrt(17);       # 4.123105625617661

        root(170000);   # 412.31056256176606
        sqrt(170000);   # 412.31056256176606
    end.

Success! But ... What just happened? There's a lot going on in this case-study.

1. | The body-expression of ``iterated`` shows the first of the conditional forms:
   |    *expression-1* ``if`` *test* ``else`` *expression-2*.

2. So-called *where-clauses* can have as many definitions as you like.
   The main ``root`` function defines two sub-functions in this manner.

3. You can nest sub-functions as deeply as you like.
   The function ``good_enough`` is within ``iterated``, which itself is within ``root``.

4. In the function ``good_enough``, we meet `scientific notation`_.
   ``1e-14`` is one over ten trillion, or a very *very* small number for most practical purposes.

5. The built-in function ``fabs`` stands for "absolute-value of" and is effectively ``fabs(x) = x if x >= 0 else -x``,
   but in native code. The ``f`` in ``fabs`` comes from a historical accident, and I will probably remove it
   from a near-future version of the interpreter.

6. This illustrates a design technique: The function ``iterated(x, y)`` does most of the work,
   and is `recursive`_ with two parameters. So the outer function ``root(square)`` must
   provide an initial set of values for those parameters.

   When you write a recursive algorithm, you should spend a moment to convince yourself that it always terminates.
   In our case, Isaac Newton has already done most of the work four hundred years ago,
   as long as you start with a positive number.
   It might not go so well if you feed in a negative number, but that's a topic for a bit later on.

7. There are limits to the precision of numerical operations in computers.
   The built-in ``sqrt`` can determine square-roots to slightly more precision in a single operation
   than what we can accomplish with several separate operations. (It's also much faster.)

.. _recursive: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion_(computer_science)

..

    Normally, it's best to use the standard-library functions rather than re-build from scratch.
    But then again, normally you'll already know how to use the langauge.
    This exercise is just practice for learning the concepts.

Wrapping Up
..............

We have seen how to do multi-way selection based on conditions,
and we have seen a short-cut notation when there are only two options.
Internally, they both translate to the same form (and it resembles the "short-cut").
One or the other syntax will more or less represent how you think about
any given decision point.

Seven Moving Parts
-------------------

This might be a good point to pause and reflect.
You have seen functions and decision points.
In principle, that's enough to compute anything that can be computed.

The Holy Trinity of structured programming is *sequence, selection, and repetition*.
We're doing something even holier than structured, though.
We're doing *pure* functional programming with *call-by-need*.

So far, we've seen:

* Arithmetic and Logic.
* Selection among alternatives.
* Functional abstraction, by which we obtain sequence and repetition.

We've yet to tackle:

* Organizing information internal the program for proper access.
* Influencing the world, such as displaying something or writing to long-term storage: Output.
* Getting information from the outside world into the program: Input.
* Interconnecting sections of program written by different people at different times and places: a module system.
* The eventual plans for solving *big* problems with Sophie.

Fantastic Lists and Where to Find Them
--------------------------------------------

So far, almost all the data in the tutorial has been numbers,
with the occasional bit of text (what programmers often call "strings" for historical reasons).
In the small, most things do boil down to letters and numbers,
but we're often interested in treating coherent groups of information as a unit.
In other words, we want structured data.

Sophie provides two primary data structuring conventions: records and variants.

Case Study: Music Archive
..........................

Suppose you're going to write some code that deals with a library of music.
You might end up with some type definitions like this::

	type:
	year is number;
	track is (title:string, artist:string, published:year, recorded:year);
	album is (title:string, published:year, tracks:list[track]);

Line by line:

1. The ``type:`` section goes before any ``define:`` or ``begin:`` section.
2. The word ``year`` is made a synonym for ``number``.
3. Next, ``track`` is defined to have a title, artist, year of publication, and year when it was recorded.
4. Finally, we define ``album`` to have its own title and year, but also a list of tracks.
   Thus, ``track`` and ``album`` are both record definitions.

Here's some sample expression of an album::

	sample = album("50 Public-Domain Songs", 2022, [
		track("After You Get What You Want, You Don't Want It", "Irving Berlin", 1925, 2021),
		track("Some of These Days", "Shelton Brooks", 1925, 2022),
	]);

	some_year = sample.published;

Notice a few things:

* Record definitions behave somewhat like functions.
  We can create an album or a track by giving arguments in the correct type and sequence.
* You can write a list of things with commas between and surrounded by square brackets.
  The syntax looks like ``[`` *element* ``,`` ... ``,`` *element* ``]``.
  If it makes life easier, you can optionally include a comma after the last element.
* An empty list is spelled ``nil``, even though we don't yet have an example here.

Lists in Sophie are sequences of all the same type of object. You can have lists of numbers,
lists of strings, lists of tracks, even lists of other lists;
but then those other lists must themselves all have the same type of entry.

So, for instance, ``[1, "apple"]`` is not a list because it contains elements of dissimilar type.

You can also make lists one element at a time, using the ``cons`` constructor.
These are two ways to write the exact same list::

	begin:
		cons(1, cons(2, cons(3, nil)));
		[1, 2, 3];
	end.

Obviously the second way is much preferable for many cases,
but when you're composing lists functionally it's handy to have the other.

Now, you might be wondering how to get at data in lists.
This is a good time to look at the code for the ``map`` built-in function::

	map(fn, xs) = case xs:
		nil -> nil;
		cons -> cons(fn(xs.head), map(fn, xs.tail));
	esac;

How to explain this? On two levels: what it does, and how it works.

* ``map`` takes a function (from type A to type B, let's say) and a ``list[A]``;
  and produces from these a ``list[B]`` by applying the function to each element in succession.

* ``map`` works by deconstructing each ``cons``, applying the function to the head, and constructing a new ``cons``.
  Naturally when it finds ``nil`` it's done.

For context, let's look at the definition of ``list``::

	list[x] is case:
		 cons(head:x, tail:list[x]);
		 nil;
	esac;

So, every ``list`` is *either* a ``cons`` or an empty-list (called ``nil``.)
We call ``cons`` and ``nil`` the two constructors of ``list``.
We *define* ``list`` with a ``case`` construction, and we *take apart* a ``list`` with a ``case`` construction.

Note that we don't *just* define ``list``. We actually define ``list[x]``.
The ``x`` is a placeholder for some other type: the element-type for any given list.
It works sort of like the argument to aa function: you can supply whatever ``x`` you need when you need it.
We go on to use ``x`` in the definition of the ``cons`` constructor.

Getting back to ``map``:
The phrase ``case xs:`` says we've got a different answer depending on which constructor ``xs`` is built with.
In the outer function body, ``xs`` is known only to be a ``list``,
but within the ``cons ->`` branch, ``xs`` certainly has the subtype of ``cons``,
so we can access ``xs.head`` and ``xs.tail`` only within that branch.



*Talk about:*

* Infinite lists and finite prefixes of them.
* The built-in list-processing functions.
