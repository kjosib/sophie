Learn Sophie
=========================================

Welcome, and thank you for taking the time to learn Sophie.
She's a little different from what the average coding boot-camps are teaching these days,
but *vive la diff√©rence!* I hope she gives you a new perspective on CS.

Initial Preparations
---------------------

Sophie is first and foremost a language for expressing ideas about computations that might happen.
That means you can write *and reason about* Sophie programs without any computer.
Sophie is meant to be suitable for the blackboard or publication in a magazine.
There are no special formatting requirements.

But if you'd like to put your computer up to the task of evaluating (executing, running) Sophie programs,
you'll need an interpreter. You can get one easily enough:
Follow the directions at :doc:`quick_start` and then come back here.

Your First Program in Sophie
------------------------------

Virtually every programming tutorial starts the same way::

    begin:
        "Hello, World!";
        "All done here.";
    end.

If you followed directions earlier, you already have a copy of this program at ``examples/hello_world.sg``.
The effect of

.. note:: Future versions of Sophie may change things. If (when) that happens, expect the documentation to follow along.

Super-Fancy Calculator
--------------------------

This section starts with the ``some_arithmetic.sg`` example.

Then it should move on to talk about functions.
I will need to build a few in.

Next, it should introduce user-defined functions.

Making Decisions
--------------------

Introduce the conditional forms.
