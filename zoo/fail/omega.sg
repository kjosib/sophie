# There is an unknowable expression, and it looks like this:
define:
    omega = omicron(omicron) where
        omicron(x) = x(x);
    end omega;
end.

# It cannot type-check. It certainly cannot run, either.
# The proper type of omicron appears to be a countably-infinite nest of arrows.
# The type of omega never even gets started.

# I'm guessing this is an example of the need for the "occurs" check.
