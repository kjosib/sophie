# Let's see what happens when you try dividing by zero:

define:
    reciprocal(x) = 1.0 / x;
begin:
    reciprocal(0);

# You should get a stack trace, but in terms of Sophie code files,
# not in terms of the evaluator's own code.

# I consider it far too much trouble to make division return a maybe-number.
# We can just all agree that division by zero is anomalous, and not do that.
# Eventually, this concept should integrate with whatever process-supervision notions Sophie acquires.
