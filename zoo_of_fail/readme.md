# Zoo of Malformed Code

The primary function of a compiler is not to translate source to binary.
That's the easy part.
The primary function is to report on things that should not be translated.
In other words, this folder is for broken Sophia code which ought not translate.
Test cases expect one or another phase of translation to fail for each file.

There are some other test-cases that just include tiny scripts inline,
so not every kind of problem is necessarily represented here.
